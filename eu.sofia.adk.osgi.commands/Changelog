* Changed the SofiaCommandProvider::create method, so now if no -props are provided, default one will have at least the first address found
  in the inspection process (in the TcpIPGatewayConfiguration class) will be used. Besides, if props are provided, the gw is TCP/IP and a list
  of IPADDRESS=X pairs is passed as props, they are parsed and inserted in the TCPIPGatewayConfiguratio properties maps as ADDRESSES-ArrayList<String>.
  Then, the SocketChannelAcceptor will start listening in the indicated IPs.
