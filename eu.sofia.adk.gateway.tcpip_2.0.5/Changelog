* Changed the SocketChannelAcceptor class, method initServerSocket so now it starts the listenning socket
  in the IP stored in properties, not just in localHost address as before. Address is obtained from
  the one selected by the user in the gateway wizard.
  
* Modified the getDefaultProperties method from the TCPIPGatewayConfiguration class, so it lists for 
  the available network interfaces and the addresses attached to them and stores them in the properties
  within the NETWORK_ADAPTER new key.

* Modified the getDefaultProperties method from the TCPIPGatewayConfiguration class, so now the IPs from the first
  network adapter that has valids IPs are used to insert a pair ADDRESSES-ArrayList<IPs> in the properties map. This
  was needed because if the SIB is started from the command line and no props parameter is provided indicating the
  IPs to be used, the SIB will not start in the SocketChannelAcceptor because the properties map of the 
  TCPIPGatewayConfiguration had no ADDRESSES key. Thus, by inserting in the inspection process this solves the issue.
