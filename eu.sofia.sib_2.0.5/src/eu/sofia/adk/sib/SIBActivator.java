/** 
 * The activator class for the Semantic Information Broker (SIB).
 * 
 * A plug-in subclasses this class and overrides the appropriate life cycle 
 * methods in order to react to the life cycle requests automatically issued 
 * by the platform. For compatibility reasons, the methods called for those 
 * life cycle events vary, please see the "Constructors and life cycle methods" 
 * section below.
 * 
 *  Conceptually, the plug-in runtime class represents the entire plug-in 
 *  rather than an implementation of any one particular extension the plug-in 
 *  declares. A plug-in is not required to explicitly specify a plug-in 
 *  runtime class; if none is specified, the plug-in will be given a default 
 *  plug-in runtime object that ignores all life cycle requests 
 *  (it still provides access to the corresponding plug-in descriptor).
 *  
 *  In the case of more complex plug-ins, it may be desirable to define a 
 *  concrete subclass of Plugin. However, just subclassing Plugin is not 
 *  sufficient. The name of the class must be explicitly configured in the 
 *  plug-in's manifest (plugin.xml) file with the class attribute of the 
 *  <code><plugin></code> element markup.
 *  
 *  Instances of plug-in runtime classes are automatically created by the 
 *  platform in the course of plug-in activation. For compatibility reasons, 
 *  the constructor used to create plug-in instances varies, please see the 
 *  "Constructors and life cycle methods" section below.
 *  
 *  The concept of bundles underlies plug-ins. However it is safe to regard 
 *  plug-ins and bundles as synonyms.

	 * Starts up this plug-in.
	 * 
	 * This method overrides the Plugin class in subclasses that need to do 
	 * something when this plug-in is started. The start class calls the
	 * <code>super()</code> method to ensure that any system requirements 
	 * can be met.
	 * 
	 *  If this method throws an exception, it is taken as an indication that 
	 *  plug-in initialization has failed; as a result, the plug-in will not 
	 *  be activated; moreover, the plug-in will be marked as disabled and 
	 *  ineligible for activation for the duration.
	 *  
	 *  Plug-in startup code should be robust. In the event of a startup 
	 *  failure, the plug-in's shutdown method will be invoked automatically, 
	 *  in an attempt to close open files, etc.
	 *  
	 *  <code>Note 1</code>: This method is automatically invoked by the 
	 *  platform the first time any code in the plug-in is executed.
	 *  
	 *  <code>Note 2</code>: This method is intended to perform simple 
	 *  initialization of the plug-in environment. The platform may terminate 
	 *  initializers that do not complete in a timely fashion.
	 *  
	 *  <code>Note 3</code>: The class loader typically has monitors acquired 
	 *  during invocation of this method. It is strongly recommended that this 
	 *  method avoid synchronized blocks or other thread locking mechanisms, 
	 *  as this would lead to deadlock vulnerability.
	 *  
	 *  <code>Note 4</code>: The supplied bundle context represents the plug-in 
	 *  to the OSGi framework. For security reasons, it is strongly recommended 
	 *  that this object should not be divulged.
	 *  
	 *  <code>Note 5</code>: This method and the stop(BundleContext) may be 
	 *  called from separate threads, but the OSGi framework ensures that both 
	 *  methods will not be called simultaneously.
	 *  
	 *  <strong>Clients must never explicitly call this method.</strong>
