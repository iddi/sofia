* Changed the JoinRequest class, method processRequest to avoid KPs not being able to reconnect when
  connection is interrupted (unplugged or whatever the reason) and they try to re-connect 
  It was checking if the session already existed, which it did, and thus didn't allow
  to reconnect. Although it works, we don't recommend it since this is a very nasty
  feature (Not removig a KP when dropped and allowing to reconnect...)
  
* TODO : Review this, this should be done some other way, there is very high risk of making a 
  "rabbit" KP that only makes JOINS and could make a DOS attack to the SIB

* Also changed the name of the SessionManager.addNode method name to addSession, for the shake of clarity
